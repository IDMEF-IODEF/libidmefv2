# Everything up to the first line that starts with a number in the
# first column is copied into the output verbatim.  Then, empty lines
# are ignored.  Other lines must have an error source number, followed
# by one or more <tab> characters, followed by the error source
# symbol, followed by one or more <tab> characters, followed by the
# error source name.  Trailing whitespace is removed.  The error
# sources should be sorted.  The last line should not have a number,
# but only a <tab>, followed by a description for error sources that
# are not in the list.
